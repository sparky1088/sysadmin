====== Okta ======
Created Monday 01 February 2021

Okta lets you export hacking attempts or failed logins for reports. Blocking these is usually a good idea, make sure you exclude remote workers IPs and your office IP.

I usually upload this to a google sheet file and use the following query (you may have to change the columns)

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
=SORT(UNIQUE(QUERY('Okta Report 12'!2:1000,"SELECT M, R, S WHERE M !='IP.OF.OFF.ICE' AND R !='United States' AND S !='United Kingdom' AND Y IS NOT NULL")),1,TRUE)

}}}


This and Jumpcloud need to be expanded...
