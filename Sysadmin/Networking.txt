====== Networking ======
This is just a bunch of stuff that I have to look up constantly. I am working on organizing it.

===== IP Tables: =====
This is to maintain persistent connections for already established sessions so a rule doesnt fork you over when chagning things
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
}}}

or
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
}}}


To save IP Tables:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# iptables-save > /path/to/file
}}}


To manually restart IP Tables (I had this initially for a raspberry pi):
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4
}}}

or
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# cat /etc/iptables/rules.v4 | iptables-restore
}}}



===== Test network speeds: =====
iperf is a great program for this it will need to be installed on both a client machine and a server machine.
To start the server:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
iperf -s
}}}

To start the client:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
iperf -c ip.of.ser.ver
}}}


===== Wierd Interface things: =====
Interface **NOT** releasing IP Address:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# sudo ip addr flush interface-name && sudo systemctl restart networking
}}}

==== Useful Ping Notes: ====
Pretty ping is a useful package

Ping using specific interface
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
ping -I eth0 google.com
}}}

Ping useing specified IP source
ping -S IP destination
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
ping -S 10.0.0.5 google.com
}}}

Usually I cap my ping count with a -C 5 with aliases.
