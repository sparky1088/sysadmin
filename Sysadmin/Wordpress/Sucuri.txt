====== Sucuri ======
Created Thursday 04 February 2021

Sucuri is a Global Endpoint Secuirty for Wordpress it costs about 300 dollars per site (so it is expensive) but it has lots of nice firewalling features.
One thing to note is that it tends to cache quite a lot. I have also noticed some lag time in its creation of certificates.
