====== Ubuntu Issues ======

===== Trackpad =====
Still havn't figured this guy out, but it is most likely the motherboard from my readings and not actually an ubuntu issue.


===== Sound =====
Sound not working correctly
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.config/pulse/* ; rm -r ~/.pulse*

}}}

wait ten seconds, then run this: 
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
pulseaudio -k 

}}}

==== Ubuntu DNS ====
For a problem with local cache:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
computer# sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved

}}}

I found this because dig, host and nslookup all returned something old while the dns servers returned the new one when I did a dig against them specifically. I noticed port 53 had systemd-resolve running on it using ss -tupln | grep 53 (alternative to netstat)

To show what your dns servers are in the network manager you have to use the nmcli
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
computer# nmcli device show <interfacename> | grep IP4.DNS

}}}


===== Sometimes stuck in boot loop =====
This is the error message I managed to get
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
pcieport cant change power state from D3cold to D0 config space unavailable

}}}

After searching it looks like it might be an nvidia driver issue:

If updating it doesnt work or changing the settings suggested I plan on reinstalling the machine from scratch for this one.
