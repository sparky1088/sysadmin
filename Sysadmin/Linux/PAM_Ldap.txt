====== PAM Ldap ======

Usually what I do is install //ldap-utils ldapscripts libldap-2.4 libldap-common libnss-ldap libpam-ldap //and// nslcd.//
I also copy the configs from other servers for the files: 
///etc/pam_ldap.conf //
///etc/nsswitch.conf//
///etc/ldap/ldap.conf//
///etc/libnss-ldap.conf//

I then restart nscd.

Sometimes when adding ldap authentication to a new server using PAM. I found that you have to install //libpam-ldap// and //libpam-ldapd// as well  due to the config file being in a different location. It usually goes through the same prompts as the other for the config.

I found the problem. One of the guides I found on Google instructed me to do

apt-get install libnss-ldap libpam-ldap nslcd

I also later found an article that said that libpam-ldapd is newer than libpam-ldap and installed that instead.

libnss-ldap prompts you for some configuration and creates a /etc/libnss-ldap.conf file. Then libpam-ldap uninstalls libnss-ldap but leaves its config file behind. Apparently that config file is still meaningful because that's the one it's using and I had an error in the binddn in that file. After fixing the binddn, it worked.

I really don't know why you'd install both of those ldap modules. After getting the first client VM working, I setup another client VM using just libpam-ldapd and nslcd and it worked first time.

===== Jxplorer =====
jxplorer is a software that allows for ldap browsing. It can be installed with apt.

===== NSCD =====
nscd uses a chaching system. Most of the time this isnt a problem as i can update one day and later it comes back fine. Sometimes users need immadiate changes to be sync'd (most often the change is adding a group to a user)

sudo nscd --invalidate=groups
