==== Mac issues ====
Sometimes macs have the jumpcloud service stop. When this happens the user cannot log in. It is always recommended to have a separate IT account. You have to login to the Admin account and start the service.  

FIRST MAKE SURE THAT THE COMPUTER IS CHECKED OUT AND NOT SYNCING (Device Status in Jump Cloud)

To check or change the agent status on a Mac, run as root
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
[root@mymac ~]# launchctl list | grep jumpcloud
23392    -15    com.jumpcloud.darwin-agent

}}}


With process snapshot 
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
[root@mymac ~]# ps -fax | grep jumpcloud
	0 23392     1   0  6:06PM ??         0:00.01 /bin/bash ./jumpcloud-service.sh
	0 23398 23392   0  6:06PM ??         0:00.26 ./bin/jumpcloud-agent --conf=jcagent.conf

}}}


Launchctl will automatically try to start the service if it's loaded. If the service isn't running, make sure it's loaded
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
[root@mymac /opt/jc]# launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jumpcloud.darwin-agent.plist

}}}


To restart
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
[root@mymac /opt/jc]# launchctl stop com.jumpcloud.darwin-agent

}}}


To force a stop, unload the LaunchDaemon
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
[root@mymac ~]# launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jumpcloud.darwin-agent.plist

}}}
