Created Monday 30 November 2020

Inoticed my DNS is being set to 127.0.0.53 meaning it is a local host. After searching aroud I found https://askubuntu.com/questions/973017/wrong-nameserver-set-by-resolvconf-and-networkmanager

I am still showing it using myself as the dns server when using things. Its possible that the service is using myself as the dns. Ill do some research on this.

It looks like it does work this way, applications will use the local host dns that comes from the dns of systemd-resolved.

This means some weird things with dig.
