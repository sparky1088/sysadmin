====== Gmail ======
Created Tuesday 01 September 2020

===== Search Email =====
There are many parameters that google allows you to use to help narrow down search results. The ones I use the most are //in:Inbox //and //from:email@domain// or between two dates using  //before:YYYY-MM-DD and after:YYYY-MM-DD// as there isn't a between function. The full list is in the support article below.

Using the size operations made it easier to clean up space on gmail.

===== Email Blocking =====
Blocker an email address from your gmail/gsuite is straight forward except if the address is emailing a group.

To block the address on an individual account simply click the 3 dots on the email in gmail and select block address.

1. You need to add the address to the blocked senders list.
	* Sign in to your Google Admin console.

==== Group Blocking ====
In the case of a group i had to have a compliance content rule.
I noticed the the regex test that google had did not match the regex test I used but I ended up removing the ^ and $ for the beginning and end of line and it worked.

Create a receiving rule for the organizational unit that shouldnâ€™t receive email from some other organizational unit.

1. From the Admin console Home page, go to Appsand thenG Suiteand thenGmailand thenCompliance.
	* Note: You might find this setting at Appsand thenG Suiteand thenGmailand thenAdvanced Settings.
2. On the left, select the organizational unit that you want to apply the receiving rule to, such as Elementary School Students.
3. Scroll to the Compliance section, point to the Content compliance setting, and choose an option:
	* Click Configure.
	* If the setting is already configured, click Edit or Add another.
4. Add or update a description for the rule, such as Prevent elementary school students from receiving email from messages with high-school and middle-school headers.
5. Under Email messages to affect, check Internal - receiving.
6. Under Add expressions that describe the content you want to search for in each message, click Add.
7. Under Expressions, select Advanced content match in the drop-down list.
8. Under Location, select Full headers.
9. Under Match type, select Matches regex.
10. Under Regexp, enter: 
	^X-user-type: (high-school|middle-school)$
	* In our case I used X-Original-Sender: email@provider.com
11. Under Regex Description, enter Reject message if it is marked with high-school or middle-school.
12. Click Save.
13. Under If the above expressions match, do the following, select Reject message from the drop-down menu.
14. Under Customize rejection notice, enter a description for the sender to receive so that they understand why the message was returned to sender.
	* For example, This message has been rejected because your organization is not allowed to send email to the Elementary School Students organization.
15. Click Add setting.
16. Click Save.

===== Admin Search =====

This is what I had to do to search for an email from another organization that was not showing up.

1- Access to your admin console > Reports > Audit > Email log search
2- There you will have a panel to make a search. Please enter the email address of the sender in the field "From:"
3- Click on "Search"
4- This tool will provide you with a results of all incoming emails from that email address

* This tool, "Email log search", is a way for us to be able to look inside our mail servers. With it we are able to see all the email flow, incoming and outgoing emails, if a message was affected by a forwarding rule, if a message was rejected by our mail servers.

If a message is sent to our mail servers, it will leave a record that is visible through this tool, if we do not find a record of said message this means that the message was never sent correctly to our servers, so we conclude that something happened at the origin of the message, in other words, a problem on the sender's side.
