====== HFS Mounting ======
We had some drives that were defaulted to the HFS file system and I couldn't get it to mount correctly on Ubuntu 20

First, make sure that you have hfsprogs installed. Example installation command:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
computer# sudo apt-get install hfsprogs

}}}

Next, mount or remount the HFS+ drive; commands need to be as follows:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
computer# sudo mount -t hfsplus -o force,rw /dev/sdXY /media/mntpoint

}}}

or
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
computer# sudo mount -t hfsplus -o remount,force,rw /mount/point

}}}
