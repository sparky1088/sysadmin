====== ZFS ======

ZFS Snapshots of file systems are accessible in the //.zfs/snapshot// directory within the root of the file system. For example, if //tank/home/cindy// is mounted on ///home/cindy//, then the //tank/home/cindy@thursday// snapshot data is accessible in the ///home/cindy/.zfs/snapshot/thursday// directory.
