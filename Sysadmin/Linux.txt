--------------------

==== l2tp VPN ====
For some reason the default ubuntu (at least on 16 and 18 when i last checked) did not have support for l2tp vpns. I had to disable the xl2tp service as well but that may no longer be nesasary.

1. Install network-manager-l2tp network-manager-l2tp-gnome (I think xl2tpd was installed by default)
2. Stop the xl2tp service sudo systemctl stop xl2tpd.service
3. Disable the xl2tp service sudo systemctl disable xl2tpd.service
4. You may need to restart
5. In the Phase1 Algorithms use 3des-sha1-modp1024
6. In the Phase2 algorithms use 3des-sha1
