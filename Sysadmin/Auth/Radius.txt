====== Radius ======
Created Thursday 04 February 2021

This is how you ldap can communicate to the router using a radius for auth to a vpn or to a machine etc.

In Freeradius you have to configure your clients in [[/etc/freeradius/3.0/clients.conf]] make sure you have  a section like the following
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
#client 192.168.0.0/16 {
#       secret          = testing123-2
#       shortname       = private-network-2
#       ipaddr          = 127.0.0.1
#       nastype         = cisco/mikrotik/etc
#}

}}}


Full list of nas types should be in the config but just in case:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
        #       cisco
        #       computone
        #       livingston
        #       max40xx
        #       multitech
        #       netserver
        #       pathras
        #       patton
        #       portslave
        #       tc
        #       usrhiper
        #       other           # for all other types

}}}


You can also name your client based on a name rather than the IP/subnet eg
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
#client router_name {
#       secret          = testing123-2
#       shortname       = private-network-2
#       ipaddr          = 127.0.0.1
#       nastype         = cisco/mikrotik/etc
#}

}}}
