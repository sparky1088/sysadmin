====== MacOS ======

I don't do much using a Mac, most things work on unix and for most tools you can find a solution.
sshfs is a great tool to install in my oppinion.

=== Restoring a Mac ===
When restoring a Mac, permissions may change or get messed up so you will have to probably reconfigure them. This happened once before where bash stopped working entirely.

===== VPN =====
For some reason when [[MacOS]] gets updated it will sometimes cause a VPN to stop working (same thing happens with windows sometimes) I usually just recreate the VPN and it works fine.

===== Display Link =====
I don't do much on mac but one of the things I have had to do a number of times is install display link drivers.
