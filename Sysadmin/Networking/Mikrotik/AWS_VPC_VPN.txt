====== AWS VPC VPN ======

You can download the VPN instructions but it does not include a couple of items that are needed and some trouble shooting tips.

1. You have to create a **IPSec Peer** before you can create a **IPSec Policy** for it now, I am guessing this is a versioning thing where older versions it did not matter.
2. The //SA Src.// and //SA Dst. Addresses //Are based on the peer (this is why it needs to be created first)
3. When Added you local subnet and VPC Subnet **IPSec** **Policy **you need to make sure to select Tunnel (this is not stated in the instructions for the local subnets only for the NAT'd Addresses).
4. If using **BGP **//instead// of **Static Routes**
	a. Only leave 1 instance running (not both) as it will treat both as active but you cannot have both VPNs active (aws sets up 2 simultaneous vpns but Mikrotik doesnt support Active/Active or Active/Standby for VPNs). Sometimes traffic will try to route through the inactive VPN
	b. The AS number for the BGP Instance can be acquired from AWS under **Customer Gateway **in** VPC Settings** This defaults to 65000 (priave range is ASNs 64,512 to 65,534 ).
	c. The Router ID is the external address added on the 169.254.X.X subnet (This should be obvious but I wanted to document it in case I forget in the future.
	d. **BPG** needs //Redistribute Connected//, //Redistribute Static//, and to make sure you uncheck //Client to Client Reflection// in the **Instance** setting, This was in the default instance, but I don't know if it is a default setting or not because we had to add one with the right AS number.
5. In the **VPC > VPN > Site-Site VPN Connections **and then under the tab **Tunnel Details** you can see the status of the VPN.
	a. If the Details says //IPSEC IS UP //but the status is //DOWN// then BGP is not working and has an incorrect config.
	b. If the status is //UP// but things are not working you most likely need a route on the VPC to the local subnet.

Static Routes Might be easier to make, its been a while Since I've had to set that up in a VPN manually though and it was not on a Mikrotik but a Cisco in the past.

I'll include an anonymized config after I go through it.

 - this was mostly helpful to determine if IPSec was working, but BGP not working.
