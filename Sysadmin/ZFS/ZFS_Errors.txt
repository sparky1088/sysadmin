====== ZFS Errors ======

===== ZFS NFS =====
For some reason sometimes i have to reshare the nfs settings on zfs mount points
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
zfs set sharenfs=rw=123.45.67.89/24,crossmnt,no_root_squash data/san

}}}

as well as sometimes having to restart the nfs kernel
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
systemctl start nfs-kernel-server

}}}


===== zpool status error =====
When you run 
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
zpool status

}}}

and it retuns a `DEGRADED` error along with
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
The READ and WRITE columns provide a count of I/O errors that occurred on the device, 
while the CKSUM column provides a count of uncorrectable checksum errors that 
occurred on the device.

}}}


The second section of the configuration output displays error statistics. These errors are divided into three categories:

* READ – I/O errors that occurred while issuing a read request
* WRITE – I/O errors that occurred while issuing a write request
* CKSUM – Checksum errors, meaning that the device returned corrupted data as the result of a read request

These errors can be used to determine if the damage is permanent. A small number of I/O errors might indicate a temporary outage, while a large number might indicate a permanent problem with the device. These errors do not necessarily correspond to data corruption as interpreted by applications. If the device is in a redundant configuration, the devices might show uncorrectable errors, while no errors appear at the mirror or RAID-Z device level. In such cases, ZFS successfully retrieved the good data and attempted to heal the damaged data from existing replicas.

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
zpool clear

}}}

is the only method to reset the error counters.

I have also seen this when an iscsi device was not correctly showing as a device and had to login to it again. See [[../../Hardware/iscsi.txt|iscsi]]

===== zfs-utils unistalled problem =====
zfs-linux-utils got unistalled. I reinstalled it but the pool didnt exist. However i was able to find it with, 
 
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo zpool import -d /dev

}}}

This comand lists all pools that can be found as well as their number which can be used to import it under a different name.

and it showed up and I was able to import it

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo zpool import pool_name

}}}
