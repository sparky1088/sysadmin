====== dhcpd ======

dhcpd is a DHCP daemon that will send out dhcp leases to computers on a network.The config file is located in ///etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf//. 

This will allow you to search the lease list:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
Server$ dhcp-lease-list --parsable | grep "name or IP"

}}}


You can also simply check the file ///var/lib/dhcpd/dhcpd.leases// for the same information.
