====== Networking ======
This is just a bunch of stuff that I have to look up constantly. I am working on organizing it. Some external [[+External Network Tools|NetTools]] can be found in that section

===== TCP Dump: =====
Basic tcpdump to host with port:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# tcpdump -i <interface OR any> host <host IP for src or dst> and port <port>

}}}

write to file with verbose output to a specific host:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# sudo tcpdump -vvv -n host 123.45.67.89 -w capture.cap

}}}

read cap file (you can also import this into wireshark):
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# tcpdump -r capture.cap

}}}

I think this is looking for a specific time in a capture file (when you do this make sure to note that the timestamps i believe come from the machine where the capture happened) 12:30 specifically im not sure what the secondary grep was
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# tcpdump -l -n -r capture2.cap ip |grep "^12:3" >12:3.txt
computer# grep "37\.43947" 12.3.txt >12.3.port43947.txt

}}}


===== IP Tables: =====
This is to maintain persistent connections for already established sessions so a rule doesnt fork you over when chagning things
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

}}}

or
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

}}}


To save IP Tables:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# iptables-save > /path/to/file

}}}


To manually restart IP Tables (I had this initially for a raspberry pi):
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4

}}}

or
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# cat /etc/iptables/rules.v4 | iptables-restore

}}}



===== Test network speeds: =====
iperf is a great program for this it will need to be installed on both a client machine and a server machine.
To start the server:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# iperf -s

}}}

To start the client:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# iperf -c ip.of.ser.ver

}}}

===== Wierd Interface things: =====
Interface **NOT** releasing IP Address:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# sudo ip addr flush interface-name && sudo systemctl restart networking

}}}

--------------------

===== ipcalc =====
This is a tool for subnet calculations
ipcalc <ADDRESS1> - <ADDRESS2>  deaggregate address range

ipcalc <ADDRESS>/<NETMASK> --s a b c
							split network to subnets
							where a b c fits in.
Examples:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# ipcalc 192.168.0.1/24
computer# ipcalc 192.168.0.1/255.255.128.0
computer# ipcalc 192.168.0.1 255.255.128.0 255.255.192.0
computer# ipcalc 192.168.0.1 0.0.63.255

}}}

===== Useful Tool for creating ACL's and BanLists =====
This site allows you to create ACL's and Banlists based on country which can be very useful. Warning, this creates MASSIVE lists as you are blocking entire countries.

==== Useful Ping Notes: ====
Pretty ping is a useful package

Ping using specific interface
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# ping -I eth0 google.com

}}}

Ping useing specified IP source
ping -S IP destination
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# ping -S 10.0.0.5 google.com

}}}

Usually I cap my ping count with a -C 5 with aliases.
