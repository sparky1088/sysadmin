====== NVMe ======
 
Recently had a server that used nvme drives (2 actually) some things to note

1) server A had additional ssd's this works well when using debian, however speeds for io using zfs were problably 10 times slower than ssd's

Speeds were tested using fio. I'll get the exact tests and put them in here.

2) server B did not have the additional drives and I could not get debian to install no matter what i did (including using  a flashdrive as a boot disk) the problem it was having was it was unable to install grub dummy. I tried everything I could think of but could not manage to get it to boot until I put CentOS on it rather than Debian.

I tried various configurations including using legacy bios (which did successfully install but would not boot).

Server A was SuperMicro
Server B was a Dell
