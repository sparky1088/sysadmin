One of the things this version was needed for was empting trash from a team drive

}}}


===== Transfer Ownership Accross Domains =====
As of writing this it is not possible. The only reason I've had to do this is leaving a company and a google doc is something that I either put in the wrong drive. The only way I found to do it is to simply make a copy of the file. It's a rare enough thing that I usually don't have to worry about it or I can copy and paste.

===== Send from Printer/Scanner =====
In order to send from a printer, the printer will need its own email address (technically you can use yours but this is less secure). I followed the google documentation. Keep in mind that this is not the best/most secure way to scan and send something.

Its mostly the smtp settings that need to be correct.
