====== Bind ======

2 big things as notes for bind, if you are doing a cname make sure to include the . at the end. 
eg:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
ntp     IN     CNAME     server.com.

}}}


If you are syncing bind to another server make sure you change your serial (this is the first option in the SOA. 
I believe ithe other options default to seconds so you do not have to include a unit.
eg:
We added the following SOA record to the db.movie.edu file:

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
movie.edu. IN SOA toystory.movie.edu. al.movie.edu. (
						  1        ; Serial
						  3h       ; Refresh after 3 hours
						  1h       ; Retry after 1 hour
						  1w       ; Expire after 1 week
						  1h )     ; Negative caching TTL of 1 hour
						  
}}}


I personally prefer to just increase the serial by 1 but I have seen where the serial is actually the date in the format of yyyymmdd
For example
19980706 being July 7, 1998 and then lets you change it on March 3, 2000 you would change it to 20000303.
The benefit to this is you can see when it was last edited, however if you have to make 2 edits in a single day or fix an edit you still have to increase and you can see when a file was last edited on linux using the stat or ls -l commands. If there is another benefit I do not know it.
