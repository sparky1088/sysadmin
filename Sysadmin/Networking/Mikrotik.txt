====== Mikrotik ======

===== Winbox =====
Winbox works on mac, linux (must use wine) and windows but it is an amazing tool and will allow you to connect to your machine even without an ip address.

===== NAT (Network Address Translation) =====
In order to NAT any address you have to give Mikrotik the address. 
This is done under IP > Addresses

*Firewall for NAT make sure you set things to //accept FORWARD// and not //accept INPUT// or something else.

===== Hairpin NAT =====
hairpin nat on a mikrotik so things resolve correctly internally
