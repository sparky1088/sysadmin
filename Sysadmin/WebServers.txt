====== WebServers ======

===== Combining Certs =====
This is for all web servers, I always have to check how you combine the certs together.
OpenSSL: Convert CRT to PEM:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
openssl x509 -in cert.crt -out cert.pem

}}}


i dont remember if that was needed or not
this is one of the more helpful resources with certs and chains

===== Check Experiation of Cert =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
cat economicmodeling.com.crt.2020 | openssl x509 -noout -enddate

}}}



===== Self Signed Cert =====
Creating Self-Signed SSL Certificate

To create a new Self-Signed SSL Certificate, use the openssl req command:

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 \
			-x509 \
			-sha256 \
			-days 3650 \
			-nodes \
			-out example.crt \
			-keyout example.key
			
}}}


* newkey rsa:4096 - Creates a new certificate request and 4096 bit RSA key. The default one is 2048 bits.
* x509 - Creates a X.509 Certificate.
* sha256 - Use 265-bit SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm).
* days 3650 - The number of days to certify the certificate for. 3650 is ten years. You can use any positive integer.
* nodes - Creates a key without a passphrase.
* out example.crt - Specifies the filename to write the newly created certificate to. You can specify any file name.
* keyout example.key - Specifies the filename to write the newly created private key to. You can specify any file name.
