====== Xresources ======

I don't often change anything related to x and i mostly only use xrdp for funny little things, however the other day I came accross something where xclock would not work correctly in the file and ended up making a new file for it and wasnt sure how to add it.

inside [[~/.Xresources]]
add a line:
#include ".Xresources.d/xterm"

but in order to just merge the file temporarily
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
computer$ xrdb -merge xclock

}}}
