====== Samba ======

When a server went down due to some issues even after copying files over I couldn't get users to authenticate to smb.
I think it had something to do with the passwords not being created in the database from the ldap server. What I ended up doing is copying the ///var/lib/samba/// directory which included the //passdb.tdb// and I think this is what fixed it.

I usually copy the existing ///etc/smb/* // from backup or from the existing server.
