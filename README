This is a simple repository of zim notes (I am in the process of converting this into markdown along with updating adding a ton of additional info). 
I finally got tired of having these all over the pace on various things and wanted to be able to back these up so I made a git repo as well.

Nothing fancy going on.

I was using google keep for quite a bit of these but it was getting out of hand and I wanted something cleaner.
