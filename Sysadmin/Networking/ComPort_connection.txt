===== Minicom =====
minicom is a a program to connect the usb to com ports. I had some trouble getting the settings right but once I got them right everything worked smoothly. I dont remember any of the other troubles I had but there were some. I'll figure those out if I see them again and write about it.

Install the program with:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo apt-get install minicom

}}}


The config can be done using 
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
minicom -s

}}}


my current config is as follows in the default. I don't remember what the defaults were
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
cat /etc/minicom/minirc.dfl 
# Machine-generated file - use "minicom -s" to change parameters.
pu port             /dev/ttyUSB0
pu baudrate         115200
pu bits             8
pu parity           N
pu stopbits         1
pu rtscts           No

}}}
