===== DKIM =====
DomainKeys Identified Mail, or DKIM, is a technical standard that helps protect email senders and recipients from spam, spoofing, and phishing. It is a form of email authentication that allows an organization to claim responsibility for a message in a way that can be validated by the recipient.

Google has specific instructions for generating and what it has to be called but it is google._domainkey.domain.com as a text record. Some DNS companies (including route53) do not allow for 2048 keylengths so you have to generate it using 1024 sizes
In the Google Admin Console you can find it under:
**Apps > Google Workspace > Settings for Gmail > Authenticate email**

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
$ dig TXT google._domainkey.domain.com

}}}

The google documents for these are basically what were used to set them up along with what was already set up (usually if we get asked to add additional things to any of these records there is documentation specfic for it eg salesforce)
