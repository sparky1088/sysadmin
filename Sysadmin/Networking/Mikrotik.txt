====== Mikrotik ======

A good mikrotik course
https://courses.wispcasts.com/p/mikrotik-mtcna-course

===== Winbox =====
Winbox works on mac, linux (must use wine) and windows but it is an amazing tool and will allow you to connect to your machine even without an ip address.

===== NAT (Network Address Translation) =====
In order to NAT any address you have to give Mikrotik the address. 
This is done under IP > Addresses

*Firewall for NAT make sure you set things to //accept FORWARD// and not //accept INPUT// or something else. 
This rule was needed for Nat to work.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=forward comment="test nat" connection-nat-state=dstnat

}}}


==== Ports ====
When doing NAT make sure to only do specific ports and not an entire server unless you already have a firewall in place like iptables on said server that is only allow connections via specific ports.

===== Hairpin NAT =====
Hairpin nat on a mikrotik so things resolve correctly internally
https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Hairpin_NAT
Make sure these NAT rules are higher Priority than the others.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
/ip fireall nat
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat comment="Device Hairpin Nat" dst-address=Int.ip.ad.dr out-interface=core src-address=Int.net.ad.dr/16

}}}

===== BlockList =====
Creating a Deny List/Block List - This has been useful for Banning IPs that are trying to spam the network.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
/ip firewall filter add chain=input src-address-list=blocklist action=drop
/ip firewall filter add chain=output dst-address-list=blacklist action=drop
/ip firewall address-list
add list=blacklist address=1.1.1.1
add list=blacklist address=2.2.2.2

}}}

===== Internet Speeds Limits =====
For some reason we were being rate limited. After much troubleshooting we found it turned out that this was set up in the router. The previous IT guys set up the limits based on the previous speeds we were getting.

use the following to mark the packets

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
/ip firewall mangle 

}}}


you need to mark packets in order to rate limit them. Once the packets are marked use 

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
/queue tree

}}}


--- need to add specific details probably.


===== Updating =====
https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Upgrading_RouterOS
For some reason even with all the settings up and working these routers/switches can't seem to update (actually now that I think about it it is probably a firewall rule that is preventing them because they are on the switch network not the users network so the packets are being dropped).

To manually update you just have to add the new file to the root directory of the files tab

===== Errors when Opening =====
I'm not sure what caused this but it looks like a currupted session view file, but the systems are it will open for one switch but not another
I removed the ip.of.swi.tch.viw from ~/.wine/drive_c/users/mwaldorf/Application Data/Mikrotik/Winbox and then it worked fine. I did loose the stuff i had in the sesision but I dont remember what it was anyways.
