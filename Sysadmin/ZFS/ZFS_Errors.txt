====== ZFS Errors ======


===== zpool status error =====
When you run 
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
zpool status
}}}

and it retuns a `DEGRADED` error along with
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
The READ and WRITE columns provide a count of I/O errors that occurred on the device, 
while the CKSUM column provides a count of uncorrectable checksum errors that 
occurred on the device.
}}}


The second section of the configuration output displays error statistics. These errors are divided into three categories:

* READ – I/O errors that occurred while issuing a read request
* WRITE – I/O errors that occurred while issuing a write request
* CKSUM – Checksum errors, meaning that the device returned corrupted data as the result of a read request

These errors can be used to determine if the damage is permanent. A small number of I/O errors might indicate a temporary outage, while a large number might indicate a permanent problem with the device. These errors do not necessarily correspond to data corruption as interpreted by applications. If the device is in a redundant configuration, the devices might show uncorrectable errors, while no errors appear at the mirror or RAID-Z device level. In such cases, ZFS successfully retrieved the good data and attempted to heal the damaged data from existing replicas.

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
zpool clear
}}}

is the only method to reset the error counters.
