====== Zabbix ======

===== Encryption =====
Zabbix supports a few different ways of encryption. Use the documentation for the appropiate version.
https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.0/manual/encryption
https://www.zabbix.com/forum/zabbix-troubleshooting-and-problems/51955-how-to-setup-psk-encryption


===== zabbix_get =====
zabbix_get is used from the commandline to pull values of keys zabbix monitors.
If you have an interface set up on the machine itself rather than using NAT make sure to use the -I ip.add.re.ss option.
eg:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
computer# zabbix_get -s agent.machine.address -I server.ip.address -k "system.cpu.load[,avg1]"

}}}

otherwise if you are using NAT make sure the agent file has the internal ip or dns name for the server or the commands wont work.
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
Server=zabbix.internal,192.168.1.15
ServerActive=zabbix.internal,192.168.1.15

}}}

The command for an internal is almost the same
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
computer# zabbix_get -s agent.machine.address -k "system.cpu.load[,avg1]"

}}}
