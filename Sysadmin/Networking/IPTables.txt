====== IPTables ======
Created Thursday 06 May 2021

This is to maintain persistent connections for already established sessions so a rule doesnt fork you over when chagning things
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
-A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

}}}

or
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

}}}


To save IP Tables:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# iptables-save > /path/to/file

}}}


To manually restart IP Tables (I had this initially for a raspberry pi):
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4

}}}

or
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
computer# cat /etc/iptables/rules.v4 | iptables-restore

}}}


Some basic rules can be found here:

==== IPSET ====
iptables can also use the ipset package. This lets you create ipsets for your firewall rules in iptables.
I have only used this very limitedly (as in it was already in place) in a file under /etc/ipset.list
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
create set-name hash:net family inet hashsize 1024 maxelem 65536
add set-name 192.168.0.0/22
add set-name 192.168.8.0/22
add set-name 192.168.32.0/23
add set-name 10.10.0.0/22

}}}


A quick search lead me here it doesnt contain many examples but hopefully it will help.

This has much more examples:
