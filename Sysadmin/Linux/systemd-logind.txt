====== systemd-logind ======
We had some complaints about the time it takes to login to a server (specifically using ssh) having increased significatly after a server move.
I checked some of the basic things (UseDNS set to no) etc.
I did some googling and found a lot of people were talking about systemd-logind service.
After running 
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo watch systemctl status systemd-logind

}}}


I noticed systemd.logind kept restarting every 30 seconds or so and never actually fully activated.
I then proceeded to run
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo journalctl -fu systemd-logind

}}}

This let me know the error that it was running into.

The error was:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
Service has no hold-off time, scheduling restart.

}}}

After doing some digging around I found that it might be that systemd didn't load the service correctly.

And it was recomended to run:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec

}}}

I wasn't sure what that did but after searching it looks like it just restarts the systemd process and should not interfere with any already existing connections etc.
