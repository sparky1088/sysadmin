===== Install a package from backports =====

All backports are deactivated by default (i.e. the packages are pinned to 100 by using ButAutomaticUpgrades: yes in the Release files. If you want to install something from backports run:

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
computer# apt-get -t buster-backports install "package"

}}}


of course you can use aptitude as well:

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
computer# aptitude -t buster-backports install "package"

}}}
